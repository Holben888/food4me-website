      <p>
        We all know someone who has restrictions on what they can eat. Whether
        you're gluten-free, vegan, or you're giving up food for lent, you've
        probably made sacrifices to make your body and your mind happier. So
        how do you navigate restaurant menus built on pre-seasoned meals, and
        the server who always needs to "ask the chef" for the slightest
        changes? Most of the time, you end up either "just getting the salad,"
        eating at home, or visiting a select few chains you can trust. So, we
        seek to address the root of the problem head-on:
        <strong>How do you find nearby restaurants that meet your dietary
          needs?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Enter Food4me, a mobile application that uses your unique dietary
        profile to find nearby meals that work best for you.
        <strong>Customers</strong> can explore restaurants in their area and
        join the conversation by reviewing and offering recommendations for
        their favorite spots. What's more,
        <strong>restaurant owners</strong> will be able to describe any
        accommodations they can provide to quickly draw in users from our
        platform.
